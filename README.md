Flags of the world quiz

Quiz your flag knowledge with more than 200 flags from across the world. Including nations, minor islands, and more!

Requires a few modules to effectively run from the Jupyter notebook:
* random, json, PIL, glob, matplotlib, IPython, time

If you'd rather play within the terminal itslef, you'll only need 
* random, json, PIL, glob, matplotlib

Credit for all flags and countries used: https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags
* You'll want to download at least the countries.json & png1000px to the same directory as your FlagQuiz.py or FlagQuizJupyter.ipynb file
